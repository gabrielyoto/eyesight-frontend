## About

Eyesight is an app to help people visually disabled to have a sight of their surroundings in an amplified way, describing sonorously the objects around you.  
It uses the smartphone's camera to get the image that is processed by the neural network and to give a feedback to the user.

## How to run

```bash
yarn
yarn android # runs in android
yarn ios # runs in iOS
```
